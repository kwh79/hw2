    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Kyle is a record collector living in sunny and tropical Chicago, IL. He likes
      traveling to new cities to scour dusty record store bins for used treasures,
      but mainly just looks for records on eBay from the comfort of his house.
      He's a noted collector of punk and hardcore records that most people have
      never heard of (rightly so) and would consider pretty terrible.
